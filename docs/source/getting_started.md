# Getting started

## Requirements

poliastro requires a number of Python packages, notably:

- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), for physical units and time handling
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), for basic numerical routines
- [jplephem](https://pypi.org/project/jplephem/), for the planetary ephemerides using SPICE kernels
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), for static orbit plotting
- [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) (when using CPython), for accelerating the code
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), for interactive orbit plotting
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), for root finding and numerical propagation

poliastro is usually tested on Linux and Windows on Python 3.7 and 3.8
against the latest NumPy. It should work on OS X without problems.

## Installation

The easiest and fastest way to get the package up and running is to
install poliastro using [conda](https://conda.io/docs/):

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge poliastro=0.14
```

```{note}
We encourage users to use conda and the
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) packages for convenience,
especially when developing on Windows. It is recommended to create a new
environment.
```

If the installation fails for any reason, please open an issue in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues).

### Alternative installation methods

If you don\'t want to use conda you can [install poliastro from
PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poliastro/) using pip:

```bash
$ pip install numpy  # Run this one first for pip 9 and older!
$ pip install poliastro[jupyter] pytest
```

Finally, you can also install the latest development version of
poliastro [directly from GitHub](http://github.com/poliastro/poliastro):

```bash
$ pip install https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/archive/main.zip
```

This is useful if there is some feature that you want to try, but we did
not release it yet as a stable version. Although you might find some
unpolished details, these development installations should work without
problems. If you find any, please open an issue in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues).

```{warning}
It is recommended that you **never ever use sudo** with distutils, pip,
setuptools and friends in Linux because you might seriously break your
system

Options are [per user
directories](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7143496/554319),
[virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) or [local
installations](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4325047/554319).
```

### Using poliastro on JupyterLab

After the release of Plotly 3.0, plotting orbits using poliastro is
easier than ever.

You need to install the jupyterlab, which will install the necessary
dependencies, including plotly. You can do this using pip:

```bash
$ pip install jupyterlab
```

And then start the jupyter-lab with:

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```

And as the documentation of JupyterLab Extensions states:

> \"In order to install JupyterLab extensions, you need to have Node.js
> version 4 or later installed.\"

If you face any further issues, you can refer to the [installation guide
by
Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/master/README.md#jupyterlab-support-python-35).

## Problems and suggestions

If for any reason you get an unexpected error message or an incorrect
result, or you want to let the developers know about your use case,
please open a new issue in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues) and we will try
to answer promptly.
